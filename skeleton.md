What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

When the screen is resized to less than 500px, the layout automatically changes so all the content fits on the screen.

It is able to do so as the site was developed "mobile first". The CSS rules were originally set for a screen less than 550px. Once the screen is expanded beyond this width, by the use of media queries, a different set of CSS rules applies.

This is called a responsive design.
